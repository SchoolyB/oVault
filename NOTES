//Initial backend system setup:
    backend program  starts
    "super user" is created
    "secure" project is created under super user
    "users" collection is created in "secure" project
    
    
//User registration from frontend:
    user enters password and email credentials
    those credentials get sent via a POST request to super users `projects/secure/collections/users/cluster/.....` for stoarge
    
    
    //User login from frontend:
        now anytime we want to check an individual user log in we just GET the info from the "users " collection
    

issues:

ISSUE 1: HOW IN THE FUCK does the frontend get the bear token???
Solution 1: 
generate a .env file, use Odin to get JWT somehow, store in .env file. then read from that file from the frontend
